aptible-sass
===
This repo contains Aptible's common SASS assets for many of our customer-facing
sites. Compatible with Bootstrap 3.

It currently consists of two files: a file of custom variables and mixins,
and a global sheet for site-wide and header/footer styles.

### Installation

1. `bower install aptible-sass`
2. (add paths to SASS manifest)
3. (add images - you will need to add background images to `#circle-logo` (footer) and `nav .navbar #brand_link`)

### Use

1. Include your custom SASS after these resources in the repo.


### TODO
Extract container/layout specific variables into separate spec.
